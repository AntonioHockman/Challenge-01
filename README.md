# Challenge-01
first HW challenge
First i consolidated some of the repetitive code in css
I changed title element in html
I added comments to html and css for clarity
I changed <div> class=contents into <section> for separation and better reading. also changed <div class="benefits"> into a section element as well.
added other semantic elements. div class hero was changed to <figure>
changed div class= header, to <nav> 
added alt discriptions to images
class hero image was a url in css, i added title="meeting of 4 people" as a discription css could relate too.
